# Coqui Public Model License 1.0.0
https://coqui.ai/cpml.txt


This license allows only non-commercial use of a machine learning model and its outputs.


## Acceptance


In order to get any license under these terms, you must agree to them as both strict obligations and conditions to all your licenses.


## Licenses


The licensor grants you a copyright license to do everything you might do with the model that would otherwise infringe the licensor's copyright in it, for any non-commercial purpose. The licensor grants you a patent license that covers patent claims the licensor can license, or becomes able to license, that you would infringe by using the model in the form provided by
the licensor, for any non-commercial purpose.


## Non-commercial Purpose


Non-commercial purposes include any of the following uses of the model or its output, but only so far as you do not receive any direct or indirect payment arising from the use of the model or its output.


### Personal use for research, experiment, and testing for the benefit of public knowledge, personal study, private entertainment, hobby projects, amateur pursuits, or religious
observance.


### Use by commercial or for-profit entities for testing, evaluation, or non-commercial research and development. Use of the model to train other models for commercial use is not a non-commercial purpose.


### Use by any charitable organization for charitable purposes, or for testing or evaluation. Use for revenue-generating activity, including projects directly funded by government grants, is not a non-commercial purpose.


## Notices


You must ensure that anyone who gets a copy of any part of the model, or any modification of the model, or their output, from you also gets a copy of these terms or the URL for them above.


## No Other Rights


These terms do not allow you to sublicense or transfer any of your licenses to anyone else, or prevent the licensor from granting licenses to anyone else. These terms do not imply
any other licenses.


## Patent Defense


If you make any written claim that the model infringes or contributes to infringement of any patent, your licenses for the model granted under these terms ends immediately. If your company makes such a claim, your patent license ends immediately for work on behalf of your company.


## Violations


The first time you are notified in writing that you have violated any of these terms, or done anything with the model or its output that is not covered by your licenses, your licenses can nonetheless continue if you come into full compliance with these terms, and take practical steps to correct past violations, within 30 days of receiving notice.  Otherwise, all your licenses
end immediately.


## No Liability


***As far as the law allows, the model and its output come as is, without any warranty or condition, and the licensor will not be liable to you for any damages arising out of these terms or the use or nature of the model or its output, under any kind of legal claim. If this provision is not enforceable in your jurisdiction, your licenses are void.***


## Definitions


The **licensor** is the individual or entity offering these terms, and the **model** is the model the licensor makes available under these terms, including any documentation or similar information about the model.


**You** refers to the individual or entity agreeing to these terms.


**Your company** is any legal entity, sole proprietorship, or other kind of organization that you work for, plus all organizations that have control over, are under the control of, or are under common control with that organization.  **Control** means ownership of substantially all the assets of an entity, or the power to direct its management and policies by vote, contract, or otherwise.  Control can be direct or indirect.


**Your licenses** are all the licenses granted to you under these terms.


**Use** means anything you do with the model or its output requiring one of your licenses.
